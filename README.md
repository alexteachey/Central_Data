# Central Data

## These are just some data files I use a lot, might come in handy for other folks. If you're looking for very sophisticated / deeply vetted stuff, look elsewhere.

*Here's a quick description:*

[**GOSE_TTV_summaryfile.csv**](https://github.com/alexteachey/Central_Data/blob/main/GOSE_TTV_summaryfile.csv) -- Here are transit timings we produced for about ~775 planets. I've taken 500 draws from the joint posteriors produced for our Orbital Sampling Effect paper ([Paper](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AJ....155...36T/abstract) | [Repository](https://github.com/alexteachey/TTV_posteriors)) to produce transit timings and uncertainties (see the paper for more information on the methodology). From there I just fit a line to get a best period linear ephemeris, and computed deviations from that line. Every epoch is represented -- no quality filtering (large errorbars are a good hint that something is amiss with individual transits). Fast and dirty, use with discretion. *This is a comma-separated value file... open with Excel (or alternative) or Pandas.*

[**cumkoi_forecast_masses.csv**](https://github.com/alexteachey/Central_Data/blob/main/cumkoi_forecast_masses.csv) -- Takes the planet radii for every KOI in the [cumulative KOI list from NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=cumulative) (as of January 28, 2021) and uses the [FORECASTER code](https://github.com/chenjj2/forecaster) to predict masses for these planets. Note that this has been done in a far more sophisticated manner by Chen and Kipping ([Paper](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.473.2753C/abstract) | [Repository](https://github.com/chenjj2/forecasts)) but this is maybe a bit easier to access. *This is a comma-separated value file... open with Excel (or alternative) or Pandas.*

[**every_kic_lc_list.npy**](https://github.com/alexteachey/Central_Data/blob/main/every_kic_lc_list.npy) -- Prett self-explanatory. It should be a list of every KIC light curve. Note this is *NOT* the same thing as the full list of KICs... there's a whole lot more of those (about 13 million?). This is the list of the ~200,000 light curves that were obtained by *Kepler* -- many of which do not have known planets, but are downloadable. *This is a numpy array. Load using numpy.load()*

[**every_kic_lc_without_a_planet.npy**](https://github.com/alexteachey/Central_Data/blob/main/every_kic_lc_without_a_planet.npy) -- Sometimes you want to look at a light curve that isn't ruined by all those pesky planets. This list is for you. *This is a numpy array. Load using numpy.load()*
